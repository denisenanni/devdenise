1. Think through the problem. Read the codebase and write a plan in tasks/todo.md.
2. The plan should be a checklist of todo items.
3. Check in with me before starting work-I'll verify the plan.
4. Then, complete the todos one by one, marking them off as you go.
5. At every step, give me an high level explanation of what you changed.
6. Keep every change simple anc minimal. Avoid big rewrites.
7. At the end, add a review section in todo.md summarizing the changes.
8. Don't use any.
9. After writing the code, analyze it and confirm it follows security best practices, check that no sensitive data is left in the frontend, and that there are no vulnerabilities that an attacker could exploit.
10. After finishing ask me if I want to be walked through the code you just wrote explaining the functionality in detail. Act like a senior engineer teaching me.
